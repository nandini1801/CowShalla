# 🐄 COWSHALA

Cowshala is a Flask-based web application designed to assist farmers and veterinarians by offering two key functionalities:
Cattle Breed Prediction: Identify cattle breeds from uploaded images using a trained ResNet18 model.
Cattle Disease Diagnosis: Predict cattle diseases based on symptom inputs using a trained Random Forest classifier.

Additionally, the application uses Google Gemini AI to generate insights and provide treatment and care recommendations based on regional practices.

## Features
Breed Prediction: Upload cattle images to identify their breed using a customized ResNet18 model.
Disease Diagnosis: Input various symptoms to receive disease predictions from a Random Forest model.
AI-Generated Insights: Uses Google Gemini AI to provide detailed insights on cattle breed characteristics and treatment suggestions.
Responsive Design: Templates and static files have been structured for an intuitive user experience.

## Tech Stack
Backend: Flask, Python

Machine Learning: PyTorch (ResNet18), Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy, joblib

Image Processing: PIL (Python Imaging Library)

AI Integration: Google Generative AI (Gemini)

Frontend: HTML, CSS
